Github Commit History
=====================

This library can be used to display the latest X commits on a repository. It uses jQuery to fetch data from the Github API. 

The default styling is similar to what Github displays in the commit log. 


Usage
-----

To use this library on your website download it (see Downloads) or clone the repository.

Have a look at the demo to see how it works. You can have multiple listings on a single page, just change the id of the div container. 

The file "_commit.html" works as a template. It uses mustache.js to apply the values to the template.


ToDo
----

* Simplify usage
* Provide minified version of the library
* Provide paging / limiting
